# Exercise 4 - GitFlow Strategy

Answer each question here under the question.

## What is a programming language?
A programming language is languege use by editors to write binary code that pc can read in human tongue.

## What is a compiler?
It's a program or runtime that translates the written code into machine* code.
*most of the time, ends up as assembly or byte.

## What is a debugger?
It's tool that is used to test and find bugs/errors. It allows the programmer to monitor and see breakpoints.

## What is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

## What does it mean to be a programmer?
Being a programmer means you have to understand how systems and concepts work. Be creative enough to manipulate data to achieve your desired result using your knowledge.

## Is C a high level programming language? Why?
I think we need to first understand the capabilities of C to understand it fully. In my opinion C is a Middle language. Because although it has similarities with the high level languages. This should not surprise us as almost all programming languages was inspired from C as C was and still is widely popular. The why for me considering C as a middle level language is that it has the easy readability like the high level languages, yet still gives the control and manipulation of data that low level languages are known for(such as assembly).

## What is voltage? What is the unit of voltage?
It's a unit for the electrical power. (Volt, V, U)
The pressure of electricity.

## What is current? What is the unit of current?
An ampere, or amp, is the international unit used for measuring current. It expresses the quantity of electrons flowing past a point in a circuit over a given time.

## What is resistance? What is the unit of resistance?
In electrical terms. - It's the ratio between voltage (volt) applied to the flowing current (amp). (Ohm, OMEGA symbol, Î©, R)
In physical terms - It's how much friction two object glides with each other.

## What is the most manufactured device in history?
The transistor is most manufactured device in history.

## What is an integer number?
It's a number with no decimals, nor fractals. Only whole numbers in the negatives and positives. 

## What is a real number?
The real number is a number that exist in real world.
*rational & irrational numbers.

## What is a prime number?
A prime number is a number that is above 1, and can only be divided with itself and the number 1 and not whole numbers.

## What is RAM(Random Access Memory)?
Its a type of storage that talks to the CPU, the RAM can only hold data as long as there is current going through it. The CPU requests and takes data from the RAM. This means that RAM is temporary storage, not permanent.

## What is ROM(Read-Only Memory)?
Its a type of chip that can store 1's and 0's, ussually stores a program a programmer has written for a specific goal. Most commonly an operating system. Which is critical, and can't be altered easily especially by consumers/users.
